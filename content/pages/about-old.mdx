老市村, located in 海头镇 of 儋州市, has embarked on an ecological revival journey, transforming from its traditional salt production roots to a model of environmental sustainability and community revitalization. Historically, the village thrived on salt farming, but the conversion of salt fields to shrimp ponds in the 1990s led to ecological degradation, loss of biodiversity, and a decline in community vitality. The shift not only resulted in pollution but also left the village without a sustainable economic base, driving the younger population to seek employment elsewhere and leading to a demographic shift towards an aging and diminished population.

In response to these challenges, the 海南省蓝丝带海洋环境保护协会 initiated an ecological restoration project, focusing on wetland restoration and waste management. The project involved the comprehensive restoration of 1800 square meters of mangrove wetlands, planting 6000 mangrove saplings, and establishing a mangrove women's patrol team to empower local women and engage the community in conservation efforts. The initiative also included educational programs to raise environmental awareness and promote waste segregation among villagers.

The revitalization efforts extend beyond ecological restoration to include cultural and economic development. The village is exploring the revival of its salt farming heritage by restoring ancient salt fields and integrating them into eco-tourism and educational projects. This not only preserves the traditional craftsmanship of salt production but also offers new livelihood opportunities for villagers, aligning with the broader vision of turning "green waters and mountains into gold and silver mountains," a Chinese concept emphasizing the economic value of environmental conservation.

These efforts have garnered recognition, with the village's project being selected as one of the "Biodiversity 100+ Global Typical Cases" by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. This acknowledgment highlights the village's commitment to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

The collaborative approach, involving government support, non-profit organizations, and community engagement, serves as a model for rural revitalization. It showcases the potential of integrating ecological conservation with cultural preservation and economic development to create resilient and vibrant rural communities.
