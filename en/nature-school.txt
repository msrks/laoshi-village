11:T43d,The location of the Laoshi Village Nature School is located on the banks of the Zhu Bi River in Haitou Town, Danzhou, Hainan, where the freshwater wetlands meet the estuary of the sea (Beibu Gulf). It originates from the clean streams of the Zhu Bi River in the Baisha Mountain area, and the nearby natural and pollution-free coastline. Laoshi Village, which has always taken 'culture' and 'ecology'd education as the concept of community building, established a nature school in 2024, using the entire village as a natural experience base to create a place for 'exchange' and 'learning'. The Nature School targets children to adults, plans various activities related to the environment, community, and outdoor teaching, and pursues communication between people and nature, people and people, and people and society. Let the 'village' become a school. Let more children grow up healthy and happy in the 'village'. Let more people see the vitality of local communities and nature, and see the beauty that everyone is born with. Because of your arrival, this community has become better.3:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":["$","body",null,{"className":"antialiased min-h-screen
